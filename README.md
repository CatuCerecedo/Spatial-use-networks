Functions and code from the paper:

**Resource predictability modulates space use networks in an endangered scavenger species** Cerecedo-Iglesias et al. submitted to Ecological Applications in 2022.

Schudle of this repository:

- **Functions_SpatialNetworks.R** file where is the information of functions created and used in this research.
- **Spatial-Network.R** file where is described the workflow carried out

These functions were developed to calculate dynamic Brownian Bridge Models, graph spatial use networks and run perturbation analysis.
